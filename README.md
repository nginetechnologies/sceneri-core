This is the home of the core libraries and runtime for [Sceneri](http://sceneri.com), the game / interactive media engine supporting creation & play of 2D and 3D experiences on and for any device.

The common library is routinely tested on:
- Windows (x64)
- Linux (x64)
- macOS (x64 & arm64)
- iOS (arm64)
- visionOS (arm64)
- Android (arm64)
- Web (WebAssembly, via Emscripten)

The library is currently provided as-is, but we encourage using it in your projects and bringing improvements back via pull requests.
